    "To calculate the velocity and angle, we first caluclate the x and y velocities independently. To do this, we take the first two data points from the x and y, subtract the first from the second, and divide by the time between them. This gives us the average velocity between those points. which we can estimate to be the starting velocities. To caluclate the magnitude and angle of the velocity, we use the Pythagoren theorem to calculate the distance between the points in 2d space, and to caluclate $\\theta$, we use the fact that $sin(\\theta) = O/H$, so $\\theta = arcsin(O/H) = arcsin(v_y / v)$\n",
